-  Welcome to the HollidayLab page. This is a home for the storage, sharing and communication of files used in our lab. We empoloy computational modeling approaches to explore 3D morphology and biomechanics of animals. Notably, we employ a mixture of CT scanning, 3D modeling, Finite Elmenent Modeling, 3D lever analysis and new 3D visualization approaches.
